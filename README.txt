Hello!

	To run my code, the files "BGA.cpp," "BGA.sh," and "StringArithmetic.h" must all be in the same folder.
Open a terminal and navigate to this folder, then run BGA.sh. This should open a prompt where you can select which
part of the task you want to run the algorithm for. Selecting A, B, or C will run my program with parameters I have
found, while typing anything else will allow you to run it with your own parameters if you so choose.
